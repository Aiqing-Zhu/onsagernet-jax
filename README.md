# OnsagerNet

This is an implementation of the *onsagernet* library in [`jax`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
with [`equinox`](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/).

---

## Installation and setup

### Install from PyPi

Install the CPU version by
```shell
pip install onsagernet
```

For the GPU version, first install the GPU version of jax
```shell
pip install "jax[cuda12]"
```
and then the package
```shell
pip install onsagernet
```

### Install from repository

If you want to run the examples in this repository, first clone the repository and then proceed as follows.

1. Install Poetry by following the instructions on this [link](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Set up env and install dependencies + package
```shell
cd <your_cloned_repository_directory>
make env
```

---

#### Selective installs

By default `make env` installs all dependencies.
You can selectively install dependencies, in which case instead of `make env`, run one of the following:

Only the main package dependencies
```shell
poetry shell
poetry install --only main
```

Only the main package and those for examples, but not development packages
```shell
poetry shell
poetry install --only main,examples
```

---

#### Using GPUs

The current `pyproject.toml` performs a CPU install.
If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU you can install the GPU version of `jax`
```shell
make env
poetry remove jax
poetry add "jax[cuda12]"
```

## Auto-generate API documentation

Generate API docs (see [pdoc](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) for details)
```shell
make docs
```
View documentation at [`./docs/index.html`](./docs/) or directly [here](https://liqianxiao.github.io/Research-OnsagerNetJax/onsagernet.html)
for the current tracked version.

---

## Testing

Run unit tests (complete coverage in progress)
```shell
make tests
```

---

## Examples

Currently there are three examples and follow the links for more details.
1. [A test case example](./examples/test_case/README.md)
2. [An example based on homogenisation in Ref [3]](./examples/n_scale_potential/README.md)
3. [An example in learning macroscopic polymer dynamics in Ref [2]](./examples/polymer_dynamics/README.md)
